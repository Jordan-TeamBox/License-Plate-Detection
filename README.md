# License-Plate-Detection
License plate detection using different networks

## I. Introduction
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence is very important to this world today, every single technological advances has to do with some machine learning and artificial intelligence including computer vision, natural language processing, autonomus driving, and much more. In this project, I wanted to test computer vision, a part of computer science and improve on it. I choose a very popular concept, license plate detection to carry out my research. First of all, my mentor and I found avery well organized article on computer vision and license plate detection. Then I used this as a framework for my research. 

## II. Research
In order to edit the code, I needed to do more research including looking into the Keras applications and documentation as this was used in the framework. I have also dived deeply in to the reference code and figured out what individual steps are doing.

## III. Project
In order to run the project, I split it into three different sections. The first section is let the computer to be able to detect where the license plate is given a picture. The second step is to recognize where the individual letters are in the lincense plate and then clean them in order to make the computer easier to detect. The last and the most important step is to train the computer using different networks and then detect the letters using machine learning.
